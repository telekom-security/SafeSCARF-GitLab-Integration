# GitLab-CI SafeSCARF

This repository provides an example implementation of [SafeSCARF](https://documentation.portal.pan-net.cloud/safescarf-product/) (based on [DefectDojo](https://www.defectdojo.org)) with [GitLab-CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/).

It supports all [GitLab SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/) tests and [Anchore Engine](https://anchore.com/opensource/).

As soon as you include this implementation the GitLab SAST test will be activated as well as the Anchore Engine based test for container images.

For having Anchore Engine working the path of the image is expected in the Variable "IMAGE_NAME".

## Usage
For using this example simple include the main file "gitlab-sast.yml" as a remote and configure at least the mandatory variables in your CI/CD pipeline.

```
include:
  - remote: "https://safescarf-integration.caas-p03.telekom.de/gitlab-safescarf.yml"
````
